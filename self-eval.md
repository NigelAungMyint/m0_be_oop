# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

```Felt good to finally take on a challenge that I couldn't easily finish without any research or collaboration.  Felt very rewarding.```
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

``` Work flow is good I think.  I get up to use the restroom or eat when I need to and pace the room if I'm thinking.  I haven't felt distracted at any point.  I am in the Zone of Proximal Development.```
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

``` More collab, more study outside of class to stay fresh and learn new things.  Maintaining a healthy workout and sleep schedule at all costs!```
